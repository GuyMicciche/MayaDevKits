# Autodesk Maya DevKits - Automated Plugin Development

Streamlined development and compilation of **C++**, **Qt**, **Python**, and **PyQt** plugins for Autodesk Maya across multiple versions (2019-2026).

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

### Required Software
1. **Visual Studio 2022** (any edition: Community, Professional, or Enterprise)
   - During installation, ensure you select: **"Desktop development with C++"** workload
   - This includes the necessary MSVC compiler and Windows SDK components

2. **Autodesk Maya** (any supported version 2019-2026)
   - Required for testing your compiled plugins

## 📥 Getting Started

### Step 1: Download Maya DevKits

1. Visit the **official Maya Developer Center**: https://aps.autodesk.com/developer/overview/maya
2. Scroll to the bottom of the page to find the **DevKit packages**
3. Download the **Windows DevKit** for each Maya version you want to support
4. You'll need an Autodesk account (free registration) to access the downloads

### Step 2: Set Up DevKit Directory Structure

1. **Create a base directory** for all your Maya DevKits, for example:
   ```
   C:\MayaDevKits\
   ```

2. **Extract each downloaded zip file**:
   - Each zip contains a root folder named `devkitBase` - **ignore this folder**
   - Extract the **contents** of `devkitBase` directly into version-specific folders
   - For Maya 2025 going forward, you need to extract the included Qt.zip into the root folder
   - For all other versions, there will be qt zip files inside the `cmake`, `include`, and `mkspecs` folders you need to extract them to compile Qt plugins.

3. **Your final structure should look like this**:
   ```
   C:\MayaDevKits\
   ├── 2019\
   │   ├── cmake\ (extract qt-5.6.1_vc14-cmake.zip contents here from included zip file)
   │   ├── devkit\
   │   ├── include\ (extract qt-5.6.1_vc14-include.zip contents here from included zip file)
   │   ├── lib\
   │   └── mkspecs\ (extract qt-5.6.1_vc14-mkspecs contents here from included zip file)
   ├── 2020\
   ├── 2022\
   ├── 2023\
   ├── 2024\
   ├── 2025\
      │   ├── cmake\
      │   ├── devkit\
      │   ├── include\
      │   ├── lib\
      │   └── mkspecs\
      │   └── Qt\ (extract this folder from included Qt.zip)
   ├── 2026\
   └── build_maya_cpp_plugin.bat  (for c++ plugins only)
   └── build_maya_cpp_qt_plugin.bat  (for any plugin, including c++ and/or Qt)
   ```

## 🚀 Building Plugins

### Step 1: Locate Sample Plugins
- Navigate to any version folder: `C:\MayaDevKits\[VERSION]\devkit\plug-ins\`
- You'll find various sample plugins (e.g., `helixQtCmd`, `helloWorld`, etc.)

### Step 2: Compile Plugins Automatically
1. **Drag and drop** any plugin folder onto the `build_script.bat` file
2. The script will automatically:
   - Detect if it's a Qt plugin (looks for `.pro` files)
   - Set up the Visual Studio environment
   - Compile the plugin for all available Maya versions
   - Output `.mll` files to `[plugin_folder]\build\[version]\plug-ins\`

### Step 3: Install and Test
1. Copy the generated `.mll` files to Maya's plugin directory:
   ```
   C:\Users\[Username]\Documents\maya\[version]\plug-ins\
   ```
2. Open Maya and load the plugin:
   ```python
   # In Maya's Script Editor
   import maya.cmds as cmds
   cmds.loadPlugin("your_plugin.mll")
   ```

## 🔧 Advanced Usage

### Manual Build Commands

If you prefer manual building:

**For Qt plugins (Maya 2024 and earlier):**
```cmd
# Open Developer Command Prompt for Visual Studio
cd path\to\your\plugin
C:\MayaDevKits\2024\devkit\bin\qmake your_plugin.pro
nmake release
```

**For all plugins (Maya 2025+):**
```cmd
cmake -H"source_dir" -B"build_dir" -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -DMAYA_VERSION=2025
cmake --build "build_dir" --config Release
```

### Directory Cleanup
To clean build artifacts:
```cmd
# For qmake builds
nmake distclean
rmdir /s /q release debug

# For CMake builds
rmdir /s /q build
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**❌ "cl.exe not found" error**
- **Solution**: Run the script from **Developer Command Prompt for Visual Studio**
- Or ensure the batch script includes Visual Studio environment setup

**❌ "Architecture mismatch" warnings**
- **Solution**: Maya requires 64-bit builds. Use `vcvars64.bat`, not `vcvars32.bat`

**❌ Plugin fails to load in Maya**
- **Solution**: Ensure you're using the correct Maya version's DevKit
- Check that all dependencies are properly linked

**❌ Qt-related linking errors**
- **Solution**: For Maya 2024 and earlier, use the DevKit's qmake instead of system Qt
